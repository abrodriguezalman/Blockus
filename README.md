## Improvements

### Game Logic
This component received two S scores in Milestone 2.

### GUI
This component received an N in Milestone 2 for the rubric item "Enter Key not completed as required." This was a misunderstanding - the grader did not look in the correct method. More details in the linked Ed Thread: https://edstem.org/us/courses/56801/discussion/4972775

### TUI
This component received an N in Milestone 2 for the following rubric items:
"Running python3 src/{g,t}ui.py 20 doesnâ€™t correctly display the board, start positions, and initial randomly selected piece"
"Same as previous but for python3 src/{g,t}ui.py duo"
Same as previous but for python3 src/{g,t}ui.py mono"

These failures were due to an issue with terminal sizing. To fix this issue, I utilized the curses function resize_term() to set a default terminal size for all game board configurations. This change was implemented in line 130 of tui.py.

### Bot
This component received two S scores in Milestone 2.

### QA
This component received two S scores in Milestone 2.
